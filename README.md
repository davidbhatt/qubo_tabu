This code is written to perform a tabu search using the following algorithm:
Diversification-Driven Tabu Search (D2TS) for Unconstrained Binary Quadratic Programming  (QUBO problem)
The details of this algorithm can be found in
 Glover, F., LÃ¼, Z. & Hao, J.-K. Diversifcation-driven tabu search for unconstrained binary quadratic problems. 4OR 8, 23-253 (2010). http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10288-009-0115-y

to compile use gnumake
make

to run use
./d2ts -i inputfile
